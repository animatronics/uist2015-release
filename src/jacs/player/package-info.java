/**
 * A completely implemented animatronics show player with synchronized audio and servo motions. 
 * Requires the {@link jmcc} package and the {@link jssc} package.
 * 
 * To utilize the player,  first create a MicrocontrollerConnection ({@link jmcc}
 * package), and then create the
 * {@link FormattedShowData}, and create an
 * {@link AnimatronicsShowPlayer}. The player can then play, pause, resume,
 * and stop the show, starting and stopping at different times.
